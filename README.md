# Thapar-Soc
This is a live project implemented at intranet of our college; I am providing the local host version of the project. 

Built in PHP and MYSQL, This project aims to bring all the Thapar societies on to a single web portal where all the information about the societies is available.
This project consists of two modules :-
1. society 
2. Forum

Forum module allows us to question/Answer the queries of any type be it society related or anything else maybe programming related etc.

Students can view the societies/events and they can show their interest in the society by enrolling in it. final selections will be done via interviews only.

society heads can view the list of interested students(it may help them to make prior arrangements such as seating arrangement etc and a general idea of the popularity of the socety). They can enter the upcoming event information and answer the queries via forum module. 

Steps

1. open Xammp Server and run Mysql and Apache. 
2. keep the "college-project"(don't rename it) folder in htdocs folder inside xammp directory.
3. go to browser, type "localhost/Phpmyadmin". Import the database files named forum.sql and college.sql 
3. In browser type "localhost/college-project".
4. click on files, you will reach the home page.
